## Usage

If you have any issues using this repo, feel free to contact Jiahao @ jiahaox@unr.edu.

The proposed aggregation rule AlignIns is placed in `src/aggregation.py`, and you can easily take it and integrate AlignIns with your code.

### Environment

Our code does not rely on special libraries or tools, so it can be easily integrated with most environment settings. 

If you want to use the same settings as us, we provide the conda environment we used in `env.yaml` for your convenience.

### Dataset

CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets are available on `torchvision` and will be downloaded automatically.

Tiny-ImageNet can be easily downloaded from Kaggle.

### Example

Generally, to run a case with default settings, you can easily use the following command:

```
python federated.py \
--poison_frac 0.3 --num_corrupt 4 \
--aggr alignins --data cifar10 --attack badnet
```

If you want to run a case with non-IID settings, you can easily use the following command:

```
python federated.py \
--poison_frac 0.3 --num_corrupt 4 \
--non_iid --alpha 0.5 \
--aggr alignins --data cifar10 --attack badnet
```

Here,

| Argument        | Type       | Description   | Choice |
|-----------------|------------|---------------|--------|
| `aggr`         | str   | Defense method applied by the server | avg, alignins, rlr, mkrum, mmetric, lockdown, foolsgold, rfa|
| `data`    |   str     | Main task data        | cifar10, cifar100, tinyimagenet |
| `num_agents`         | int | Number of clients in FL   | N/A |
| `attack`         | str | Attack method   | badnet, DBA, neurotoxin, pgd |
| `poison_frac`         | float | Data poisoning ratio   | [0.0, 1.0] |
| `num_corrupt`         | int | Number of malicious clients in FL   | [0, num_agents//2-1] |
| `non_iid`         | store_true | Enable non-IID settings or not      | N/A |
| `beta`         | float | Data heterogeneous degree     | [0.1, 1.0]|

For other arguments, you can check the `federated.py` file where the detailed explanation is presented.

### Adaptive attack against `median_guard_align`

Use `adaptive_joint` to adapt to both stages of the composed defense.  The MDF
term matches each attacker's normal cosine/sign scores against a shared clean
coordinate-median proxy; the PDC term matches AvgAlign2's pairwise top-k
intersection statistics to the corresponding clean-client statistics.

```bash
python federated.py \
  --attack adaptive_joint \
  --aggr median_guard_align \
  --align_cluster_method kmeans \
  --lambda_cos 1.0 --lambda_sign 1.0 --lambda_div 0.1 \
  --adaptive_refine_steps 2 --adaptive_refine_tol 1e-3
```

`adaptive_mdf` targets only MedianGuard, `adaptive_pdc` targets only the
AvgAlign2/PDC stage (while retaining a clean local anchor), and `adaptive_joint`
targets both.  PDC refinement is active only when clustering is enabled.
